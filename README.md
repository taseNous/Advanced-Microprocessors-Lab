The AVR-IoT Wx Development Board is a hardware platform designed by Microchip Technology for developing 
Internet of Things (IoT) applications. It provides an easy-to-use environment for developers to quickly 
create, prototype, and deploy IoT solutions, particularly those involving wireless connectivity and cloud 
integration.

The board is based on an AVR microcontroller, typically from the ATmega or ATtiny family.

Microchip Studio (formerly known as Atmel Studio) is an integrated development environment (IDE) designed 
primarily for the development of applications for Microchip's AVR and SAM microcontroller families. While 
it includes a code editor as a key component, it offers a comprehensive suite of tools and features beyond 
simple code editing.
